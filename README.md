Hey, hi himanshu is here

Welcome to your To-DO List app ðŸ‘‹


## Overview
This is a simple RESTful API for a To-Do list application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

-------------------------------------getting started-------------------------------------------------------------------
## Prerequisites
documentation links are provided to dawnload and install the requirements
1) Node.js 
   NodeJS is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment built on Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser.
   Dawnload and install: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager 

2) Express 
   Express JS is a small framework that works on top of Node web server functionality to simplify its APIs and add helpful new features. It makes it easier to organize your  applicationâ€™s functionality with middleware and routing. It adds helpful utilities to Node HTTP objects and facilitates the rendering of dynamic HTTP objects.

3) MongoDB
   MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database designed for storing, querying, and managing large volumes of data. Unlike traditional relational databases that use tables and rows, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with flexible schemas, making it easier to handle diverse data types and structures

4) IDE
   IDE is software that combines commonly used developer tools into a compact GUI application.
   you can use any IDE like VSCode AndroidStudio, Eclipse etc.

## Installation


1. Clone the repository

2. Navigate to the project directory 

3. Install dependencies through terminal cmd:
   ```
   yarn init -y 
   yarn add express mongoose dotenv
   yarn add --dev nodemon
  ```
4. create mongodb collection
   `todolistData.mongodb` file contains the Queries to create collection

5. Set up environment variables
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
- Add the following:
  ```
  MONGODB_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/todo-list"
  PORT="3000"
  ```

6. Start the server
 - locate the terminal to '../TODO-LIST-APP/"
 - run ```npm start```
 - Now you can build attractive front end for this using frontend frameworks...

## API Endpoints

### Task Endpoints
- `GET /api/tasks`: Retrieve a list of all tasks.
- `GET /api/tasks/:id`: Retrieve a single task by its ID.
- `POST /api/tasks`: Create a new task.
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id`: Update an existing task.
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id`: Delete a task.

## Error Handling
Proper error handling is implemented in the middleware `errorHandler.js`.

## Testing application
You can use POSTMAN application for testing the different api calls CRUD
